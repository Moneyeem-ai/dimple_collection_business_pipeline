 ### Product Entry Page

This Django template is for a product entry page. It allows users to enter product details and upload an image of the product. The page is divided into two main sections: the camera section and the product details form.

#### Camera Section

The camera section is on the left side of the page. It contains a video element that displays the live feed from the user's webcam. There is also a button that allows the user to take a photo of the product. When the user clicks the button, the photo is saved to the `product.tag_image` field in the database.

#### Product Details Form

The product details form is on the right side of the page. It contains fields for the following product details:

* Department
* Category
* Brand
* Color
* Article Number
* Size
* WSP

* Image

The user can enter the product details into the form and then click the "Submit Details" button to save the product to the database.
